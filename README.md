# Hacked-To-Hired-Project
Welcome to project Spark! A gamified platform that helps students develop their soft skills in an interesting way to prepare them for their future. We test students to find out where they stand with the help of an aptitude test which has questions targeting these skills. The results of this test are analysed using ML/AI and each student is given a personalized learning schedule through games that targets the skills that requires improvement.

## How it Works ?
1. Students and teachers can make an account on our web app after paying a small subscription fee of $2. 
2. Once a student logs in they are taken to their dashboard and they can take an aptitude test. Our ML algorithm is applied to their answers to find out whats skills they need to improve on. Depending on the skills suggested they are redirected to the games that will help improve those skills.
3. Once a teacher logs in they are taken to their dashboard where they can monitor the progress of the students assigned to them.
